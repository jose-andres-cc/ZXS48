# ZXS48_emulator
Emulator for the Sinclair ZX Spectrum 48 written in Java

## Main questions
**Why another Spectrum emulator if there are already so many good ones?**  
Because I don't fully understand how they work internally and the best way to know how something works is to build it.

**It is new from scratch?**  
The code has been build from scratch using Java 8, but the project is based on the ideas proposed on https://efepuntomarcos.wordpress.com/2012/08/27/hazte-un-spectrum-1-parte/. The main goal is one component (CPU, memory, ULA) one class. No distributed logic between classes when can be avoided.

**Have you said Java 8?**  
Yes, it's coded in Java 8. Now almost obsolete. Also is used JavaFX, now not integrated with the last Java 8 versions.

**Current status**
The status is working in progress. You can find here the current status [here](LOG.md).

**How to start?**
At the current stage the emulator is not functional. See [status](LOG.md).
